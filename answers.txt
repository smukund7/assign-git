1.
gitignore is a text file that contains all the files that git has to ignore. Eg, all the .project files can be ignored and hence wouldn't be copied to another user's local.
the previously committed files must be ignored from the git by using git rm --cached filename and now add the filename.java (with the extension) onto your .gitignore files. 
After that, add it to your branch and commit them. Once you push it to the branch/main, it will be ignored.

Fast forward occurs when there is a direct linear path from the current branch head/tip to the intended destination branch. So, the commit is done by following the first 
commit's history and this called a fast-forward.

3.
Branching can help the development process move faster by allowing simultaneously changes, updates or commits. This way, one person's work doesn't affect the other.

4.
A project can have any number of repositories depending on how the team decides to create teams and sub-projects to get to the end product.
There were 23-25 repositories and branches in my previous project during my internship.
